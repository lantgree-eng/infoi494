# Lance's Biography

On March 10th 2001, Lansing Green-Hogue was born in Bloomington, Indiana at the Hospital in the later afternoon. He had a very energetic childhood, being raised as a kid who loved running around with friends and physical activity just as much as playing video games and watching cartoons. With these hobbies as a kid, Lance did not change much growing up, taking up similar interests such as Weightlifting, Basketball, Video Games, and Website Design. This peaked Lance's overall interest to study Informatics at Indiana University, being a very technologically enthusiastic kid. Today, Lance continues his studies in web design and is currently taking the Capstone class INFO - I494.
